Project 2 (Airline)
CS510 Advanced Programming in Java

This project uses a command line interface to model airlines and their associated flights.
The user can add flights from the command line, as well as read and write airlines/flights to and from user-specified
files.

Since the program is operated from the command line, it is designed to provide clear and helpful errors for incorrect
or improperly formatted arguments.

The bulk of this program's work is parsing the commandline(Project2.java), parsing files to build
airlines(TextParser.java), and writing airline information to text files(TextDumper.java).

Project 5 (Airline-Web)
CS510 Advanced Programming in Java

This project encompasses the client and server sides of a REST-ful airline application interface that allows the client
to add airlines and flight to the airline server and then ask the server to perform various task, such as displaying airlines or
searching for flights between two airports on a given airline.

This project uses a command line interface to model airlines and their associated flights.
The user can add flights from the command line, read and write airlines/flights to and from the server, and search for
flights.

Since the program is operated from the command line, it is designed to provide clear and helpful errors for incorrect
or improperly formatted arguments.

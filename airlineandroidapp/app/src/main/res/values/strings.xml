Project 6 (Airline-Android)\n
CS510 Advanced Programming in Java\n
\n
This project is an airline application for android that performs all the same tasks as the previous
projects (adding and searching flights, viewing airlines, pretty printing, etc.) but it uses an
application/user interface instead of a command line interface, which fundamentally changes the user
experience and data input.
\n\n
From the entry point activity, the user should be able to navigate easily through the application,
adding airlines and flights to the app, searching for flights between airports, and displaying
all flights associated with a given airline. Additionally, this application is designed to store
flights persistently, even if the app is closed or loses user focus.</string>
